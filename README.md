# publii-lotus
Theme for Publii.

## Rename the theme folder

Please rename the theme folder to `lotus`. Leaving it as `publii-lotus` will probably cause errors.

## Homepage vs Posts index

This theme expects the homepage to be a **Page** that uses the `Homepage layout` template (`page-home.hbs`). Your list of posts is not a page you create; it is generated by Publii and appears under the Post prefix once a static homepage is set.

### Setup steps (Publii 0.74.4)

1. Create a page named `Home`.
2. In the page editor sidebar, set **Template → Homepage layout**.
3. Go to **Site settings → Advanced options → SEO → Homepage** and enable **Set page as homepage**, then select the `Home` page.
4. Go to **Site settings → Advanced options → URLs** and enable **Use pretty URLs**.
5. In the same **URLs** section, set **Post prefix** to `posts`. This controls the address of the posts list (e.g., `/posts/`). The label shown in the page header is set in **Theme → Posts → Posts page title**.
6. In **Menus**, add a **Posts index link** item so visitors can reach the posts list (choose it from the **Type** dropdown).

Result:
- `/` renders your `Home` page with the homepage layout.
- `/posts/` renders the posts index.

### Homepage content

The `Homepage layout` template renders the custom theme sections first, then appends the page body content below the three columns. This lets users add their own content in the page editor and see it appear under the homepage sections.
